# Subway-Cheese-Chase
Subway Cheese Chase is Andrew Partin, Joshua Bryant, and I's MakeUC Hackathon project

In the world's eeriest digital twin of Subway, a lone sandwich artist is chased by a monster. On his break he dropped his keys to his hot pink Camaro and must use cheese to survive or die trying.

Note: This repo does not work out the box. Some of the files such as 3d models are too large to push to a github repo. Full project files and demo can be found on our dev post
